# It uses the following compileâ€‘time definitions:
#   - Access pattern is set via: -DSTRIDE (if set to 1, it is a stream access, otherwise it is a strided access)
#   - The ILP unrolling factor is set via -DILP_FACTOR
#   - Measurement mode: either -DCALC_LATENCY or -DCALC_BW
#
# The executable expects two runtime parameters: <blockSize> and <numBlocks>.
# In this script we use 1 block.
